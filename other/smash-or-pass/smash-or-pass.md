Click. Click. Click.

Is it true? What they all say?

Click. Click. Click.

No. It can't be true. 

Click. Click. Click.

My mouth waters, going through each image on the screen.

Click. Click. Click.

"Sm..."

I try to speak, but the words fumble from my dry lips. 

How long have I been here?

Hours?

Days?

It doesn't matter anymore. 

I click on the next image.

Click.

"Smash." I say.

Then click onto the next one.

"Smash. Smash. Pass. Pass. Pass. Smash."

Perhaps... I am in denial.

Would things truly get better if I simply just...

Someone knocks on the door. I simply ignore it.

The sound of a plate slides under the door. 

Later.

Maybe they are right. Maybe I just need to accept who I am.

"Smash."

Click. Click. Click.

"Pass."

Click.

"Sm... smash"

I click on the next one. But this time, I linger. Unsure.

What am I?

"Pa...? No."

I shake my head. Who am I even kidding. 

"...Smash."

Perhaps I should just accept who I am.

"Smash."

Who I have become.

"Smash."

Perhaps then I shall finally be free.
